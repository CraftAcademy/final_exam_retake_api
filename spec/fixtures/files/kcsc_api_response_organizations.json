Suddenly it can seem as though life is on lockdown — whether it's you being cared for, or you're providing care to somebody else.\nOur aim is to help unlock doors; opening up the world again so that you can re-connect with others and make choices that enrich your life.\nAt TuVida, we know that there is no 'one one-size-fits-all' formula for effective care and support. It's our aim to offer the best, most appropriate care and support to people who need it.\nWe provide one-to-one care and group support for adults and children with a wide variety of needs and conditions, at home and in the community. This also provides unpaid carers with a valuable break.\nOur vision is to see a world where every carer can live life with independence, choice and peace of mind.\nTo help achieve it, we draw on a combined organisational history of more than 150 years offering high quality care and support across England.\n",

        "Summary of Activities": "The Lateef Project was set up in 2010 to work with Muslim communities in Birmingham and is the longest running Islamic counselling service in Europe. We are an independent service that has worked with the NHS and other statutory and voluntary partners. Though the service was initially open to Muslims across Birmingham, we have worked with Muslims from all over the UK as well as Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Our face-to face service has reached people from diverse Muslim communities in several languages, providing a professional and sensitive therapeutic response to mental distress and common mental health problems, in line with the teachings of Islam. Our service has also been accessed by people of other faiths and those who do not ascribe to a particular faith.  The Lateef Project is unique in its use of Islamic Counselling – a highly respected therapeutic faith-based model developed, practiced and trained to an accredited professional qualification in the UK for 20 years.\n",

The company’s ambition is to reach an audience that fully reflects the diversity of London.\nOpera on Film will make films of our productions freely available to hospitals, care homes, hospices, shelters and schools in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and the City of Westminster, in a variety of formats.\nLast year, we launched with the acclaimed 2019 production of Verdi’s Un ballo in maschera, directed by Rodula Gatainou and conducted by Matthew Kofi Waldren, Opera on Film will be made available with subtitles to increase accessibility and understanding, and will be complemented by interviews with the creative teams.\nAs with OHP’s Schools’ Matinee performances of The Marriage of Figaro (2021) and Un ballo in maschera (2019), an education resource pack will be provided. Support will also be provided for care homes, hospices, shelters and hospitals from OHP’s Inspire team and the OHP Young Artists.\nOHP has been addressing social exclusion since 2005. With Opera on Film, the company will be able to include those who are unable to attend the theatre among the members of its audience. This vital community initiative is launched in partnership with the company’s resident orchestra, City of London Sinfonia.\nOpera on Film will be available from summer 2021.\nContact Inspire on inspire@operahollandpark.com if you would like to order Opera on Film for your hospital, care home, hospice, shelter or school.\n",

Our Inspire team has devised a series of OperaUNITY family workshops to give you and your children the chance to bond and unite through interactive music, movement and storytelling.\nWhile our in person family workshops have been postponed for the time being, we are excited for you to join us for OperaUNITY Online. This series of interactive workshops, held via Zoom, are aimed at children aged 0–5, and those with special educational needs. Each workshop blends music, movement, drama and storytelling, bringing opera to life with puppets, toys, live performances and singalong action.\nIn 2021, we’ll also be recording our workshops. They’ll be available on demand via Facebook, YouTube and IGTV for anyone who can’t attend the live session in person.\nLive workshops will take place over Zoom, usually on the second or third Friday of the month at 10am, and last for approx. 45 mins.\nBook here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9ARCudgOQI6vubKZSkteD-WbOYVIx...\n",
